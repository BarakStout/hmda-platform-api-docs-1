# HMDA Filing API

The following are HMDA Filling API endpoints

## Authorization

To file HMDA data using the API, an _bearer_ authorization token is required for all api calls. To acquire an authorization token use the `/auth` endpoint with your username and password as payload.

> Example

  ```shell
  curl -X POST \
  "<%= config[:authhost] %>/auth/realms/hmda2/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -d 'client_id=hmda2-api&grant_type=password&username={{username}}%40{{bank_domain}}&password={{password}}'
  ```

 | |
---|---
Method  |  `POST`
URL | `<%= config[:authhost] %>/auth/realms/hmda2/protocol/openid-connect/token`
Payload  | client_id=hmda2-api <br> grant_type=password <br> username={{username}}%40{{bank_domain}} <br> password={{password}}
Return  |  JSON with `access_token`

## Postman Collection

The [HMDA Postman Collection](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform/tree/master/newman/postman) can be used to file via HMDA Filing API.

## Endpoints

Use `<%= config[:filingapihost] %>/institutions/{lei}/filings` as a prefix for the following endpoints.

### Start a Filing

> Example

```shell
curl -X POST \
  "<%= config[:filingapihost] %>/institutions/B90YWS6AFX2LGWOXJ1LD/filings/2019" \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer  {{access_token}}' \
```

> JSON Response

```json
{
    "filing": {
        "period": "2018",
        "lei": "B90YWS6AFX2LGWOXJ1LD",
        "status": {
            "code": 2,
            "message": "in-progress"
        },
        "filingRequired": true,
        "start": 1572378187454,
        "end": 0
    },
    "submissions": []
}
```

For evey filing period, you must begin by starting a filing. This only needs to be done once per filing season. The `POST` will result in a `200` only for the first time it's called. If the filing for the given filing period already exists, the `POST` will return a `400`.
